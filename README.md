Welcome to BLACKJACK by falo10

I encourage you to use the code freely and practice your skills before you will bet your real money :)

If you don't know the rules of BlackJack check rules.txt file, however, you will be able to check them before the game itself.

PYTHON 3.10.4 was used to write the code, so I encourage you to update your version if you want the program to work properly.
